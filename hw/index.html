<h2>Your game title</h2>
	Goetia
<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong><br />
An RPG where you travel and befriend monsters.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    <p>
		The mechanic of recruitment is limited to once per monster. The recruitment of
		mmonsters is free, but the limitation forces the player to be cautious of when 
		they should use it. The player will be given the option to fight/recruit the 
		enemies and killing the enemy.
		<p>
	</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    <p>I have learned how to manipulate the camera, pause the game and create/use classes. 
		The groundwork has been set up and what remains is to create the GUI.</p>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong><br />
I made the sprites/spritesheets.

	an RPG where you move around killing/befriending enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong><br />
The theme I used is RPG.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong><br />
    The encounters with the monsters will be random.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong><br />
The mechcanic this prototype is evaluating is the mechanic of hitting an enemy.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong><br />
I want my players to have fun roaming around and feeling powerful.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
	</p>
		Use the arrow keys to move. <br />

		X: interact<br />
		C: cancel -creates an enemy right now for debug purposes<br />
	</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong><br />
	fighting more enemies to level up will make the game easier.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    <p>
		You hail from an ancient nation called Limi. The world was once at peace until
		the demon king sparked aggression upon the world's leader and fragmented the world.
		The world has been in constant strife, causing many species of monsters to go 
		nearly extinct. One day, you find a mystical orb that changes your life. You obtain 
		the ability to understand the language of others and you became stronger and more
		persuasive. You set out on a journey to reinstitute peace among nations once more.
