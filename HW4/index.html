<h2>Your game title</h2>
    Lunk: quest for the golden Cuccou
<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A simple top-down where you collect chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The changing of background by using the timer as an inddicator and randomness of the Cuccou's positioning allows for tension to be built.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to use a timer and how to load images.
The hardest part of this game was how to make the sprites change.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made the sprites.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The example platformer on phaser.io is the closest game to this one.

A simple game about capturing chicken.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme I used was the chicken.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    The positioning of the Cuccous are completely random.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The mechcanic this prototype is evaluating is the mechanic of hitting an enemy.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to have fun roaming around and feeling powerful.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use the arrow keys to move. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Moving diagonally allows the player to hit multiple Cuccous at once. Try to see what happens after 50 seconds...
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    Since times of old, the chicken was considered one of the most revered creatures. Some even considered the creature sacred. 
    Legend has it that there is one that bestows incredible power once slain. A single touch is all it takes for a knight to wield
    this incredible power. Lunk embarks on his quest to save his kingdom of Myrule...
